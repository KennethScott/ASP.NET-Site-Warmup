ASP.NET Site Warmup
-------------------------------------

Simple app that reads an xml file of sites to perform HTTP GETs on, to force the JIT compilation of ASP.NET sites to 
remove the first-hit delay often associated with ASP.NET web sites.

Credentials can be specified in the xml but be warned it is plain text.

*You may also run the exe with any normal help trigger (/h or /? or -? or etc..) for more information.

  Usage:
    ASPNET_SiteWarmup.exe <location>\<filename>
      Example:  ASPNET_SiteWarmup.exe c:\sites.xml
      Note:  If no credentials are necessary, simply remove the Credentials node


  XML File Layout:
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Sites>
      <Site>
        <Comment>my comments about this site</Comment>
        <URL>http://server/site</URL>
        <Credentials Domain="xxx" User="yyy" Pass="123" />
      </Site>
      <Site>......</Site>
    </Sites>
